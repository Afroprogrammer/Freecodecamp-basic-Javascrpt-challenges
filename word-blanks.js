/**
In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.
You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the wordBlanks variable. You should not change the words assigned to the variables.
You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.
 */

/**HINT** 
wordBlanks should be a string.
You should not change the values assigned to myNoun, myVerb, myAdjective or myAdverb.
You should not directly use the values "dog", "ran", "big", or "quickly" to create wordBlanks.
wordBlanks should contain all of the words assigned to the variables myNoun, myVerb, myAdjective and myAdverb separated by non-word characters (and any additional words in your madlib).
